                    The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is a professional 
                    association for electronic engineering and electrical engineering (and associated 
                    disciplines) .It was formed in 1963 from the amalgamation of the American Institute 
                    of Electrical Engineers and the Institute of Radio Engineers.
                    
                    As of 2018, it is the world's largest association of technical professionals with 
                    more than 423,000 members in over 160 countries around the world. Its objectives are 
                    the educational and technical advancement of electrical and electronic engineering, 
                    telecommunications, computer engineering and allied disciplines.
