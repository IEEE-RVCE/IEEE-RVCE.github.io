                    IEEE RVCE Student Branch was started in 2017 and since then from having few members initially to having 200+ members now, we have shown immense growth in terms of membership and the quality of events.

                    We have been successfully conducting workshops, seminars and shifted swiftly to webinars and online workshops during the pandemic because no matter what the circumstances, learning never stops.

                        The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is a professional association for electronic engineering and electrical engineering (and associated disciplines). It was formed in 1963 from the amalgamation of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and the Institute of Radio Engineers. As of 2018, it is the world's largest association of technical professionals with more than 423,000 members in over 160 countries around the world. Its objectives are the educational and technical advancement of electrical and electronic engineering, telecommunications, computer engineering and allied disciplines.

The discounts members receive on IEEE products or attending a conference makes membership a good return-on-investment. You can also get benefits for various paid events and conferences where discounts are given exclusively to members. There are often discounts

                        It's a constant challenge between finding the time to be informed, and one day discovering that you're not technically current. Our members tell us that reading IEEE publications saves them time, as they do not need to "reinvent-the-wheel" at work. IEEE publications are the world's best collection of technical information. Taking the time to read this information keeps you technically current. Investing 30 minutes with one publication could save you 40 hours of research at work.

                        There's a lot of information to be found on Google, but IEEE publications are not available for free on Google. Moreover, the quality of technical information found via Google is random and doesn't adhere to any consistent standards of technical excellence. Did you know that 60,000 patents cite IEEE information? -These patents cite IEEE, not Google. IEEE membership is much more than access to information. It's about networking, professional development, and you take personal responsibility for your career. Membership is about meeting new colleagues and coming into contact with really great people.
